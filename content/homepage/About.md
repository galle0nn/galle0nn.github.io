Hello there. I'm **galle0n** and welcome to my blog. I am a former chemist trying to transition into the cybersecurity industry. Because there are so many different fields within this industry, I spent the past year dabbling with some of the ones that seemed interesting to me. In the end, I became particularly interested in malware analysis and would like to pursue it as a career.

I have created this blog to record my journey into this field and decided that it will mostly comprise of overviews of malware samples that I have analyzed, write detection, and any miscellaneous documents related to infosec that I find interesting.
