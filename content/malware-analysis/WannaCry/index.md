# Analysis

- sha256:`24d004a104d4d54034dbcffc2a4b19a11f39008a575aa614ea04703480b1022c`
- Sample was 7zip compressed with the password of *infected*

## WannaCry
Wannacry is a ransomware malware that was first discovered in May 2017. Having infected thousands of computers around the world, it was described as a highly virulent strain of malware. WannaCry was attributed to a group known as the Lazarus Group, which is believed to be a state-sponsored group based in North Korea.

## Initial Detonation Observations



- Texts, documents, photos and videos have the `.WNCRY` extension after the filename
	- **placeholder** (Looks like it copies the files with the `.WNCRY` extension added, Original files are gone, are they deleted?)
	- Unable to open any of these files, even after trying to change the extension back
		- Files are encrypted
- Countdown timer asking to pay $300 in BTC in order to get the key to decrypt the files
	- If the ransom is not paid after the first timer expires, the price is doubled
- It is noted that *inetsim* was not running at the time of detonation
	- If *inetsim* was running, nothing appears to happen when malware was detonated

## Static Analysis

### floss
The URL `hxxp://www[.]iuqerfsodp9ifjaposdfjhgosurijfaewrwergwea[.]com` can be seen in the strings output, can hypothesize that *Wannacry* may be making a call to the domain server.
```
C:\%s\qeriuwjhrf
tasksche.exe
WriteFile
CreateFileA
CreateProcessA
hxxp://www[.]iuqerfsodp9ifjaposdfjhgosurijfaewrwergwea[.]com
c.wnry
InternetCloseHandle
InternetOpenUrlA
InternetOpenA
WININET.dll
```
*Figure 3. Strings of Interest*


### PeBear
- 32-bit, x86 architecture
- *WININET.dll* is present in the imports and corresponds with the *InternetCloseHandle*, *InternetOpenUrlA* and *InternetOpenA* API calls
- First byte has *MZ* (4D 5A) which indicates that the sample is a Portable Executable
- Virtual size = 1F8 (504) vs. Size of Raw Data = 200 (512)
	- Not a packed binary

### Cutter

- Same domain callback on the string as what was seen in floss output
- `[InternetOpenA]` - Initializes an application's use of WinINet functions, preps to open a handle to a given web resource 
	- Everything was pushed to `eax` for this call except "dwAccessType" 
- `[InternetOpenUrlA]`  - Opens a resource specified by a complete FTP or HTTP URL
	- Going to load in the URL from `[InternetOpenA]` to use with the API call, make a request to that API and whatever returns (yes it worked or no it did not), load that into `eax` as a value (1 or 0) 
	- `esi` argument used for `hInternet` - Handles current internet session. The first callback domain was moved into `esi` 

![caption|left](<images/18.png>)
*Figure 4. main method Assembly of WannaCry*

1. `eax` is loaded into `edi` where `edi` is tested to see the results of the value from `[InternetOpenUrlA]`
2. Moves `[InternetCloseHandle]` but does not *call* until after `test edi, edi`
3. `jne` expression, jumps to the *right-side* method if `edi` is not equal (if it was not completed)
	1. *right-side (0x004081bc)* : Closes domain handle, pushes `edi`, pops `edi` from stack, pops `esi` from stack
	2. *left-side (0x004081a7)*: Closes domain handle, calls `fcn.00408090` where it starts the service and begins encryption of files

![caption|left](<images/23.png>)
*Figure 5. Jump expression based on InternetOpenUrlA tested value*

- `fcn.00408090` leads to other function calls where it begins copying files in the system and creating a new filename with `.WNCRY` extension

## Dynamic Analysis

### Wireshark
- DNS query to the same domain seen from floss and cutter

![caption|left](<images/12.png>)
*Figure 7. Wireshark DNS query*

### Endpoint Behavior
- Constantly sending TCP requests to different IP addresses
	- Attempting to connect to several other hosts on the network to infect
	- **Indicators of a WORM**

![caption|left](<images/14.png>)
*Figure 8. TCP requests from Procmon*

- Suspicious directory *nsxbrhdekduihd377* was created
	- `@WanaDecryptor@.exe` `tasksche.exe`, `taskdl.exe` and `taskse.exe` executable files within the directory
	1. Staging area for the malware, where it unpacks all of its packed resources 
	2. 2nd stage of installation
- A service was created with the same name as the directory created in ProgramData (*nsxbrhdekduihd377*)
	- **Persistence mechanism**
	- If you restart your computer, WannaCry comes back on and re-encrypts anything added to the host
- Registry keys were also created

![caption|left](<images/16.png>)
![caption|left](<images/28.png>)
*Figure 9. Creation of suspicious directory and files*


### x32dbg
- The call to determine whether the malware will be activated or not
- Similar to what was seen in the `main` method from Cutter

![caption|left](<images/24.png>)
*Figure 10. Jump expression in debugger as seen in Cutter*

#### With inetsim
- `test edi, edi`, `ZF` flag is **0** so it jumps to where the malware is **not activated**

![caption|1000](<images/29.png>)
*Figure 11. Jump expression if domain callback is successful*


#### Without inetsim
- `test edi, edi`, `ZF` flag is **1** so a jump did not occur, leading to the activation of the malware with `call ransonware.wannacry.408090`

![caption|1000](<images/27.png>)
*Figure 12. Jump expression if domain callback is not successful*

****

## Conclusion
- In order for the malware to activate, it has to be able to make a call to the domain server: `hxxp://www[.]iuqerfsodp9ifjaposdfjhgosurijfaewrwergwea[.]com`
	- Domain **can't** be active for the malware to activate, if domain **is active**, nothing will happen
		- If *inetsim* was open, it would think that the domain was **active and live**, so the malware will not activate
- Once the malware is activated, it begins copying all files to the same directory and replacing them with a `.WNCRY` extension
