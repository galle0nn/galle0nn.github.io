## Redline Stealer
Redline Stealer is a malware designed to steal information from infected computers that can be purchased independently or as a subscription. It is typically distributed through phishing emails or malicious websites, and once it infects a system, collects a wide variety of information, including login credentials, banking information and personal data.

### Detect it Easy
- 32-bit / x86
- Entry point â†’ **0041ec4e**
- 4D 5A hex (MZ)
	- Portable Executable

### dnSpy
**Key Points**
- Once opened, the file read as `Sliprail.exe`
- XOR key was determined to be `Wisecracks`
- Decoding `EntryPoint.IP` lead to an address of `45.9.20[.]20:13441`
- Decoding `EntryPoint.ID` lead to an ID of `UTS`

Analyzing the `EntryPoint` class (Figure 2.), encoded strings can be seen along with a notable key string `EntryPoint.Key = Wisecracks;`. Pairing the key string with what was seen in the `StringDecrypt` and `Program` class (Figure 3.), it can be determined that *Redline Stealer* decodes and decrypts ciphertext using base64 and XOR with the key: `Wisecracks`.

#### C2 Communication

*Redline Stealer* establishes a connection to the C2 server using `EndpointConnection.RequestConnection` (Figure 4.), where a request will be sent to the decoded IP address obtained from `EntryPoint.IP`: `net.tcp://45.9.20[.]20:13441/`
